            <h3>Biking and Walking</h3>
            <p>I come from place where most of us either walked or biked for several kilometers for school or grocery shopping. I love
            Biking and Walking around neighborhood and local parks if the weather allows. Weather here in Louisiana is almost never
            optimal for either walking or biking, the humidity will kill you if you stay out longer than few minutes. Winter is
            fairly better for biking and walking around downtown, neighborhood or in park. However, the temperature can drop significantly and
            cold wind still makes it harder to bike in winter. But not all days are same, some days are perfect for walking around and biking.
            While in Lafayette I loved biking around Moncus park, Girard park, and even around beautiful UL Lafayette campus. Now I love walking and biking around Prien Lake Park.

            <h3>Running and Gym</h3>
            <p>At the ripe age of 12, I kicked off my running routine inspired by an online nugget of wisdom claiming it could boost growth hormones – my secret mission to gain some extra inches. 
                Can't say if it worked, but what stuck was my love for running, not just for the elusive height, but for the heart-healthy perks and the therapeutic release it offered during nerve-wracking moments.</p>
            <p>Fast forward to my college days in the United States, where the less-than-stellar food quality decided to play havoc with my waistline, ushering in a reign of laziness and energy shortages. 
                That's when the college gym became my haven, introducing me to the world of strength training. Now, I'm hooked on pumping iron and lifting weights, witnessing a noticeable upgrade in the aesthetics of my physique. 
                What's even better? I've found joy in guiding others through proper weight training techniques.</p>

            <h3>Road Trips</h3>
            <p>
                There is nothing more satisfying than a road trip with people you love. Rather than soaring through the skies, I relish the opportunity to traverse uncharted territories by road. 
                The allure of road travel lies in the unparalleled vistas and hidden gems that remain unseen from the confines of an airplane cabin.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the notion of continuous hours behind the wheel may initially evoke discomfort, I am a firm believer that this is the era in which we can revel in the exhilaration of extended drives, effortlessly clocking 5 to 6 hours straight. 
                It is a sensory symphony as landscapes unfold before our eyes, each mile an adventure waiting to be discovered. The open road becomes a canvas painted with ever-changing panoramas, inviting us to revel in the freedom of the journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the tapestry of life, there exists a moment when our ability to navigate vast distances may diminish. Therefore, I am an advocate for seizing the present, relishing the magic of road travel until the 
                passage of time gently nudges us toward a different pace. These journeys are not merely about the destinations but about the kaleidoscope of experiences woven into the very fabric of the roads we 
                traverse—each mile an ode to the thrill of exploration and the camaraderie shared with those who accompany us on this enchanting odyssey.

            <h3>FIFA</h3>
            <p>
                Football is such beautiful game. We get to see so many amazing players dazzling us with their skills and tricks. 
                FIFA as game has given us the opportunities to play against other teams with our favourite team and players. I love gaming
                FIFA and I find time to play couples of matches in a day. Through ups and downs my favorite club is FC Barcelona and I will stay loyal to club till my 
                last breath. Note: My FIFA tag is @PrithviTheEarthG. 
            </p>

            <h3>Personal pictures</h3>
                
            <p>
                I love taking photos of the beautiful nature around me, especially when it's at its best. You can find some of my personal photography of area around my ancestral home and other parts of Nepal.
