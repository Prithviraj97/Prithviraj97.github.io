            <h3>Biking and Walking</h3>
            <p>I come from place where most of us either walked or biked for several kilometers for school or grocery shopping. I love
            Biking and Walking around neighborhood and local parks if the weather allows. Weather here in Louisiana is almost never
            optimal for either walking or biking, the humidity will kill you if you stay out longer than few minutes. Winter is
            fairly better for biking and walking around downtown, neighborhood or in park. However, the temperature can drop significantly and
            cold wind still makes it harder to bike in winter. But not all days are same, some days are perfect for walking around and biking.
            While in Lafayette I loved biking around Moncus park, Girard park, and now I love walking and biking around Prien Lake Park.

            <h3>Running and Gym</h3>
            <p>
                I started regularly running when I was about 12 years old after I read online that running, and physical activities can increase the secreation of growth hormones.
                So I ran because I believed it will help me get taller, I am not sure if it helped. I continue to run for the cardio-vascular health benefits, and also as a medium 
                to relax, let go of nervous breakdowns. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I started going to Gym after I came to the United States for my UG. Bad food quality here in the States made me gain significant fat leading to lazinees, lack of energy, so 
                I sarted going to the college gym and do strength training. Now I love strength training, weight lifiting, and I believe it has made significant impact on the asthetics of my body. 
                I also enjoy helping others perform proper weight training.

            <h3>Road Trips</h3>
            <p>
                There is nothing more satisfying than a road trip with people you love. Rather than soaring through the skies, I relish the opportunity to traverse uncharted territories by road. 
                The allure of road travel lies in the unparalleled vistas and hidden gems that remain unseen from the confines of an airplane cabin.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the notion of continuous hours behind the wheel may initially evoke discomfort, I am a firm believer that this is the era in which we can revel in the exhilaration of extended drives, effortlessly clocking 5 to 6 hours straight. 
                It is a sensory symphony as landscapes unfold before our eyes, each mile an adventure waiting to be discovered. The open road becomes a canvas painted with ever-changing panoramas, inviting us to revel in the freedom of the journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the tapestry of life, there exists a moment when our ability to navigate vast distances may diminish. Therefore, I am an advocate for seizing the present, relishing the magic of road travel until the 
                passage of time gently nudges us toward a different pace. These journeys are not merely about the destinations but about the kaleidoscope of experiences woven into the very fabric of the roads we 
                traverseâ€”each mile an ode to the thrill of exploration and the camaraderie shared with those who accompany us on this enchanting odyssey.

            <h3>FIFA</h3>
            <p>
                Football is such beautiful game. We get to see so many amazing players dazzling us with their skills and tricks. 
                FIFA as game has given us the opportunities to play against other teams with our favourite team and players. I love gaming
                FIFA and I find time to play couples of matches in a day. My FIFA tag is @PrithviTheEarthG.
