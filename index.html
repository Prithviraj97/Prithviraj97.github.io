        <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I am Prithvi Raj Singh. I recently graduated with MS in Computer Science from University of Louisiana at
        Lafayette. I was co-advised by Dr. Raju Gottumukkala and Dr. Anothy Maida.</p>
    
    <p>I am aspiring Machine Learning Engineer with love for Computer Vision, Machine Learning Operations, and Optimization
        Problems. My primary research interest-both theory and application- is Computer Vision specially 3D object tracking
        and detection with
        application in perception system design for robots. During my time as a graduate student at the UL Lafayette, I was
        primarily involved in research and implementation of Vision Algorithms for tracking rapidly moving small objects in
        3D space.
        I am also interested on the Optimization of computer vision algorithms to enable smooth operations on small edge
        devices like JetsonTX, Raspberry Pi. Modern Vision Algorithms are very accurate in detection and tracking of larger
        slow moving
        object, however same algorithms fail to properly localize small objects like racquetball since the movement is more
        erratic leading to motion blur, and various other problems. My ambition is to work on solving the problem of
        detecting, tracking
        and trajectory tracking of fast-moving small objects using physics-based motion models, and physics-based deep
        neural networks. </p>
    
    <p>While at UL Lafayette, I was also working as a Software Engineering Research Associate for Louisiana Transportation
        Research Center. I helped various Researchers and GeoTech Engineers with implementation of their idea in to
        usable Software. I am greatly fond of Software Engineering principles and love coding, and learning new tech stack.
        I love teaching and sharing my knowledge with peers and juniors.
