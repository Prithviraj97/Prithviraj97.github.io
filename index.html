            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi ðŸ¤š! I am Prithvi Raj Singh ðŸ™‚. I am Machine Learning Research Engineer with love for Computer Vision,
                Machine Learning Operations, and Optimization
                Problems.I recently graduated with MS in Computer Science from University of Louisiana at
                Lafayette. I was co-advised by <a href="https://userweb.ucs.louisiana.edu/~nrg0821/">Dr. Raju Gottumukkala</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yCwFNtMAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Anothy Maida.</a> </p>
            <p>I finished my Undergraduate from McNeese State University majoring in Computer Science
                and math minor. I am a avid learner and explorer and I love learning cool new techs. While I am not a
                fitness freak, I value the importance of regular exercise
                in mental and physical well-being of person, so I love to do physical activities like lifting weights,
                running, yoga, and various other fitness exercises</p>
            <p>I was born in the southern part of Nepal in well known town called Birgunj. I spent most of my childhood
                in my ancestral village about 30 kilometers far from Birgunj.
                I got my primary school education in my village and moved to town for secondary education. After
                finishing highschool I travelled to the United States for further education
                and career opportunities.

            <h2>Research Interests</h2>

            <p> My primary research interest-both theory and application- is Computer Vision specially 3D object
            tracking and detection with application in perception system design for robots. During my time as a graduate student at the UL
            Lafayette, I was primarily involved in research and implementation of Vision Algorithms for tracking rapidly moving small
            objects in 3D space.
            I am also interested on the Optimization of computer vision algorithms to enable smooth operations on
            small edge devices like JetsonTX, Raspberry Pi. Modern Vision Algorithms are very accurate in detection and
            tracking of larger slow moving object, however same algorithms fail to properly localize small objects like racquetball since the
            movement is more erratic leading to motion blur, and various other problems. My ambition is to work on solving the
            problem of detecting, tracking
            and trajectory tracking of fast-moving small objects using physics-based motion models, and
            physics-based deep neural networks. </p>

            <p>While at UL Lafayette, I was also working as a Software Engineering Research Associate for Louisiana
                Transportation Research Center. I helped various Researchers and GeoTech Engineers with implementation of their idea in
                to usable Software. I am greatly fond of Software Engineering principles and love coding, and learning new
                tech stack. I love teaching and sharing my knowledge with peers and juniors.

            <h2>Thesis</h2>
            <h4>MS Thesis: Real-time Object Detection and Tracking of Fast-moving Small Objects using RGB-D camera and Computer Vision Technicques</h4>
            <p>
                The thesis explores the use of stereo camera for detection and tracking of fast-moving small objects in 3D space. Several Object  Detection and Tracking
                algorithms were experimented. For Object Detection modern YOLO algorithms like YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8 as well other mutli and single stage detectors were used.
                We implemented Kalman Filter based algorithms for the tracking purpose. After several experiments with the state-of-the-art models, the results were unsatisfactory 
                so I worked on augmenting the use of Kinematics to design new tracking system that can enhance the tracking and trajectory forecasting of fast-moving tiny objects. More details can 
                be found at: [insert link]
            </p>
            <h4>Undergraduate Capstone Project: Bidirectional autonomous robot for optimal path planning </h4>
            <p>
                Me and my friend 'Blake Drost' worked on building small robot from scratch, that could traverse in forward or backward direction to find the optimal path to reach the target.
                We implemented heuristic search algorithms which the robot used to find the optimal path before making move towards the target. The robot had multiple ultrasonic and small lidar sensors
                to detect obstacle in the path. If there were obstacle in the optimal path the robot would try to avoid it and if nothing works it will compute new optimal path from the current position
                and traverse towards that position. More details can be found in our github repository [Inser Link].
